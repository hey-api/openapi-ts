 *
 * This object MAY be extended with {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md#specification-extensions Specification Extensions}.
 *
 * **Key Expression**
 *
 * The key that identifies the {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md#path-item-object Path Item Object} is a {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md#runtime-expressions runtime expression} that can be evaluated in the context of a runtime HTTP request/response to identify the URL to be used for the callback request. A simple example might be $request.body#/url. However, using a {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md#runtime-expressions runtime expression} the complete HTTP message can be accessed. This includes accessing any part of a body that a JSON Pointer {@link https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901 RFC6901} can reference.
 *
 * For example, given the following HTTP request:
 *
 * ```http
 * POST /subscribe/myevent?queryUrl=https://clientdomain.com/stillrunning HTTP/1.1
 * Host: example.org
 * Content-Type: application/json
 * Content-Length: 187
 *
 * {
 *   "failedUrl" : "https://clientdomain.com/failed",
 *   "successUrls" : [
 *     "https://clientdomain.com/fast",
 *     "https://clientdomain.com/medium",
 *     "https://clientdomain.com/slow"
 *   ]
 * }
 *
 * 201 Created
 * Location: https://example.org/subscription/1
 * ```
 *
 * The following examples show how the various expressions evaluate, assuming the callback operation has a path parameter named `eventType` and a query parameter named `queryUrl`.
 *
 * | Expression | Value |
 * | -------- | ------- |
 * | $url | https://example.org/subscribe/myevent?queryUrl=https://clientdomain.com/stillrunning |
 * | $method | POST |
 * | $request.path.eventType | myevent |
 * | $request.query.queryUrl | https://clientdomain.com/stillrunning |
 * | $request.header.content-Type | application/json |
 * | $request.body#/failedUrl | https://clientdomain.com/failed |
 * | $request.body#/successUrls/2 | https://clientdomain.com/medium |
 * | $response.header.Location | https://example.org/subscription/1 |
 *
 * **Callback Object Examples**
 *
 * The following example uses the user provided `queryUrl` query string parameter to define the callback URL. This is an example of how to use a callback object to describe a WebHook callback that goes with the subscription operation to enable registering for the WebHook.
 *
 * ```yaml
 * myCallback:
 *   '{$request.query.queryUrl}':
 *     post:
 *       requestBody:
 *         description: Callback payload
 *         content:
 *           'application/json':
 *             schema:
 *               $ref: '#/components/schemas/SomePayload'
 *       responses:
 *         '200':
 *           description: callback successfully processed
 * ```
 *
 * The following example shows a callback where the server is hard-coded, but the query string parameters are populated from the `id` and `email` property in the request body.
 *
 * ```yaml
 * transactionCallback:
 *   'http://notificationServer.com?transactionId={$request.body#/id}&email={$request.body#/email}':
 *     post:
 *       requestBody:
 *         description: Callback payload
 *         content:
 *           'application/json':
 *             schema:
 *               $ref: '#/components/schemas/SomePayload'

/**
 * When request bodies or response payloads may be one of a number of different schemas, a `discriminator` object can be used to aid in serialization, deserialization, and validation. The discriminator is a specific object in a schema which is used to inform the consumer of the document of an alternative schema based on the value associated with it.
 *
 * When using the discriminator, _inline_ schemas will not be considered.
 *
 * This object MAY be extended with {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md#specification-extensions Specification Extensions}.
 *
 * The discriminator object is legal only when using one of the composite keywords `oneOf`, `anyOf`, `allOf`.
 *
 * In OAS 3.0, a response payload MAY be described to be exactly one of any number of types:
 *
 * ```yaml
 * MyResponseType:
 *   oneOf:
 *   - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Cat'
 *   - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Dog'
 *   - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Lizard'
 * ```
 *
 * which means the payload _MUST_, by validation, match exactly one of the schemas described by `Cat`, `Dog`, or `Lizard`. In this case, a discriminator MAY act as a "hint" to shortcut validation and selection of the matching schema which may be a costly operation, depending on the complexity of the schema. We can then describe exactly which field tells us which schema to use:
 *
 * ```yaml
 * MyResponseType:
 *   oneOf:
 *   - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Cat'
 *   - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Dog'
 *   - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Lizard'
 *   discriminator:
 *     propertyName: petType
 * ```
 *
 * The expectation now is that a property with name `petType` _MUST_ be present in the response payload, and the value will correspond to the name of a schema defined in the OAS document. Thus the response payload:
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "id": 12345,
 *   "petType": "Cat"
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Will indicate that the `Cat` schema be used in conjunction with this payload.
 *
 * In scenarios where the value of the discriminator field does not match the schema name or implicit mapping is not possible, an optional `mapping` definition MAY be used:
 *
 * ```yaml
 * MyResponseType:
 *   oneOf:
 *   - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Cat'
 *   - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Dog'
 *   - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Lizard'
 *   - $ref: 'https://gigantic-server.com/schemas/Monster/schema.json'
 *   discriminator:
 *     propertyName: petType
 *     mapping:
 *       dog: '#/components/schemas/Dog'
 *       monster: 'https://gigantic-server.com/schemas/Monster/schema.json'
 * ```
 *
 * Here the discriminator _value_ of `dog` will map to the schema `#/components/schemas/Dog`, rather than the default (implicit) value of `Dog`. If the discriminator _value_ does not match an implicit or explicit mapping, no schema can be determined and validation SHOULD fail. Mapping keys MUST be string values, but tooling MAY convert response values to strings for comparison.
 *
 * When used in conjunction with the `anyOf` construct, the use of the discriminator can avoid ambiguity where multiple schemas may satisfy a single payload.
 *
 * In both the `oneOf` and `anyOf` use cases, all possible schemas MUST be listed explicitly. To avoid redundancy, the discriminator MAY be added to a parent schema definition, and all schemas comprising the parent schema in an `allOf` construct may be used as an alternate schema.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * ```yaml
 * components:
 *   schemas:
 *     Pet:
 *       type: object
 *       required:
 *       - petType
 *       properties:
 *         petType:
 *           type: string
 *       discriminator:
 *         propertyName: petType
 *         mapping:
 *           dog: Dog
 *     Cat:
 *       allOf:
 *       - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Pet'
 *       - type: object
 *         # all other properties specific to a `Cat`
 *         properties:
 *           name:
 *             type: string
 *     Dog:
 *       allOf:
 *       - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Pet'
 *       - type: object
 *         # all other properties specific to a `Dog`
 *         properties:
 *           bark:
 *             type: string
 *     Lizard:
 *       allOf:
 *       - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Pet'
 *       - type: object
 *         # all other properties specific to a `Lizard`
 *         properties:
 *           lovesRocks:
 *             type: boolean
 * ```
 *
 * a payload like this:
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "petType": "Cat",
 *   "name": "misty"
 * }
 * ```

 *   "petType": "dog",
 *   "bark": "soft"

/**
 * The `Link object` represents a possible design-time link for a response. The presence of a link does not guarantee the caller's ability to successfully invoke it, rather it provides a known relationship and traversal mechanism between responses and other operations.
 *
 * Unlike _dynamic_ links (i.e. links provided in the response payload), the OAS linking mechanism does not require link information in the runtime response.
 *
 * For computing links, and providing instructions to execute them, a {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md#runtime-expressions runtime expression} is used for accessing values in an operation and using them as parameters while invoking the linked operation.
 *
 * This object MAY be extended with {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md#specification-extensions Specification Extensions}.
 *
 * A linked operation MUST be identified using either an `operationRef` or `operationId`. In the case of an `operationId`, it MUST be unique and resolved in the scope of the OAS document. Because of the potential for name clashes, the `operationRef` syntax is preferred for OpenAPI documents with external references.
 *
 * **Examples**
 *
 * Computing a link from a request operation where the `$request.path.id` is used to pass a request parameter to the linked operation.
 *
 * ```yaml
 * paths:
 *   /users/{id}:
 *     parameters:
 *     - name: id
 *       in: path
 *       required: true
 *       description: the user identifier, as userId
 *       schema:
 *         type: string
 *     get:
 *       responses:
 *         '200':
 *           description: the user being returned
 *           content:
 *             application/json:
 *               schema:
 *                 type: object
 *                 properties:
 *                   uuid: # the unique user id
 *                     type: string
 *                     format: uuid
 *           links:
 *             address:
 *               # the target link operationId
 *               operationId: getUserAddress
 *               parameters:
 *                 # get the `id` field from the request path parameter named `id`
 *                 userId: $request.path.id
 *   # the path item of the linked operation
 *   /users/{userid}/address:
 *     parameters:
 *     - name: userid
 *       in: path
 *       required: true
 *       description: the user identifier, as userId
 *       schema:
 *         type: string
 *     # linked operation
 *     get:
 *       operationId: getUserAddress
 *       responses:
 *         '200':
 *           description: the user's address
 * ```
 *
 * When a runtime expression fails to evaluate, no parameter value is passed to the target operation.
 *
 * Values from the response body can be used to drive a linked operation.
 *
 * ```yaml
 * links:
 *   address:
 *     operationId: getUserAddressByUUID
 *     parameters:
 *       # get the `uuid` field from the `uuid` field in the response body
 *       userUuid: $response.body#/uuid
 * ```
 *
 * Clients follow all links at their discretion. Neither permissions, nor the capability to make a successful call to that link, is guaranteed solely by the existence of a relationship.
 *
 * **OperationRef Examples**
 *
 * As references to `operationId` MAY NOT be possible (the `operationId` is an optional field in an {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md#operation-object Operation Object}), references MAY also be made through a relative `operationRef`:
 *
 * ```yaml
 * links:
 *   UserRepositories:
 *     # returns array of '#/components/schemas/repository'
 *     operationRef: '#/paths/~12.0~1repositories~1{username}/get'
 *     parameters:
 *       username: $response.body#/username
 * ```
 *
 * or an absolute `operationRef`:
 *
 * ```yaml
 * links:
 *   UserRepositories:
 *     # returns array of '#/components/schemas/repository'
 *     operationRef: 'https://na2.gigantic-server.com/#/paths/~12.0~1repositories~1{username}/get'
 *     parameters:
 *       username: $response.body#/username
 * ```
 *
 * Note that in the use of `operationRef`, the _escaped forward-slash_ is necessary when using JSON references.
 *
 * **Runtime Expressions**
 *
 * Runtime expressions allow defining values based on information that will only be available within the HTTP message in an actual API call. This mechanism is used by {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md#link-object Link Objects} and {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md#callback-object Callback Objects}.
 *
 * The runtime expression is defined by the following {@link https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234 ABNF} syntax
 *
 * ```abnf
 * expression = ( "$url" / "$method" / "$statusCode" / "$request." source / "$response." source )
 * source = ( header-reference / query-reference / path-reference / body-reference )
 * header-reference = "header." token
 * query-reference = "query." name
 * path-reference = "path." name
 * body-reference = "body" ["#" json-pointer ]
 * json-pointer    = *( "/" reference-token )
 * reference-token = *( unescaped / escaped )
 * unescaped       = %x00-2E / %x30-7D / %x7F-10FFFF
 *   ; %x2F ('/') and %x7E ('~') are excluded from 'unescaped'
 * escaped         = "~" ( "0" / "1" )
 *   ; representing '~' and '/', respectively
 * name = *( CHAR )
 * token = 1*tchar
 * tchar = "!" / "#" / "$" / "%" / "&" / "'" / "*" / "+" / "-" / "." /
 *   "^" / "_" / "`" / "|" / "~" / DIGIT / ALPHA
 * ```
 *
 * Here, `json-pointer` is taken from {@link https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901 RFC6901}, `char` from {@link https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159#section-7 RFC7159} and `token` from {@link https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2.6 RFC7230}.
 *
 * The `name` identifier is case-sensitive, whereas `token` is not.
 *
 * The table below provides examples of runtime expressions and examples of their use in a value:
 *
 * **Examples**
 *
 * | Source Location | example expression | notes |
 * | -------- | ------- | ------- |
 * | HTTP Method | `$method` | The allowable values for the `$method` will be those for the HTTP operation. |
 * | Requested media type | `$request.header.accept` | |
 * | Request parameter | `$request.path.id` | Request parameters MUST be declared in the `parameters` section of the parent operation or they cannot be evaluated. This includes request headers. |
 * | Request body property | `$request.body#/user/uuid` | In operations which accept payloads, references may be made to portions of the `requestBody` or the entire body. |
 * | Request URL | `$url` | |
 * | Response value | `$response.body#/status` | In operations which return payloads, references may be made to portions of the response body or the entire body. |
 * | Response header | `$response.header.Server` | Single header values only are available |
 *
 * Runtime expressions preserve the type of the referenced value. Expressions can be embedded into string values by surrounding the expression with `{}` curly braces.

 * There are four possible parameter locations specified by the `in` field:
 *
 * - path - Used together with {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md#path-templating Path Templating}, where the parameter value is actually part of the operation's URL. This does not include the host or base path of the API. For example, in `/items/{itemId}`, the path parameter is `itemId`.
 * - query - Parameters that are appended to the URL. For example, in `/items?id=###`, the query parameter is `id`.
 * - header - Custom headers that are expected as part of the request. Note that {@link https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#page-22 RFC7230} states header names are case insensitive.
 * - cookie - Used to pass a specific cookie value to the API.
 *
 * The rules for serialization of the parameter are specified in one of two ways. For simpler scenarios, a {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md#parameterSchema `schema`} and {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md#parameterStyle `style`} can describe the structure and syntax of the parameter.
 *
 * For more complex scenarios, the {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md#parameterContent `content`} property can define the media type and schema of the parameter. A parameter MUST contain either a `schema` property, or a `content` property, but not both. When `example` or `examples` are provided in conjunction with the `schema` object, the example MUST follow the prescribed serialization strategy for the parameter.
 *
 * This object MAY be extended with {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md#specification-extensions Specification Extensions}.
 *
 * A header parameter with an array of 64 bit integer numbers:
 *
 * @example
 * ```yaml
 * name: token
 * in: header
 * description: token to be passed as a header
 * required: true
 * schema:
 *   type: array
 *   items:
 *     type: integer
 *     format: int64
 * style: simple
 * ```
 *
 * A path parameter of a string value:
 *
 * @example
 * ```yaml
 * name: username
 * in: path
 * description: username to fetch
 * required: true
 * schema:
 *   type: string
 * ```
 *
 * An optional query parameter of a string value, allowing multiple values by repeating the query parameter:
 *
 * @example
 * ```yaml
 * name: id
 * in: query
 * description: ID of the object to fetch
 * required: false
 * schema:
 *   type: array
 *   items:
 *     type: string
 * style: form
 * explode: true
 * ```
 *
 * A free-form query parameter, allowing undefined parameters of a specific type:
 *
 * @example
 * ```yaml
 * in: query
 * name: freeForm
 * schema:
 *   type: object
 *   additionalProperties:
 *     type: integer
 * style: form
 * ```
 *
 * A complex parameter using `content` to define serialization:
 *
 * @example
 * ```yaml
 * in: query
 * name: coordinates
 * content:
 *   application/json:
 *     schema:
 *       type: object
 *       required:
 *         - lat
 *         - long
 *       properties:
 *         lat:
 *           type: number
 *         long:
 *           type: number

 *
 * The OpenAPI Schema Object dialect for this version of the specification is identified by the URI `https://spec.openapis.org/oas/3.1/dialect/base` (the "OAS dialect schema id").
 *
 * The following properties are taken from the JSON Schema specification but their definitions have been extended by the OAS:
 *
 * - description - {@link https://spec.commonmark.org/ CommonMark syntax} MAY be used for rich text representation.
 * - format - See {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md#dataTypeFormat Data Type Formats} for further details. While relying on JSON Schema's defined formats, the OAS offers a few additional predefined formats.
 *
 * In addition to the JSON Schema properties comprising the OAS dialect, the Schema Object supports keywords from any other vocabularies, or entirely arbitrary properties.
 *
 * The OpenAPI Specification's base vocabulary is comprised of the following keywords:
 *
 * This object MAY be extended with {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md#specification-extensions Specification Extensions}, though as noted, additional properties MAY omit the `x-` prefix within this object.

 *
 * **No XML Element**
 *
 * Basic string property:
 *
 * ```yaml
 * animals:
 *   type: string
 * ```
 *
 * ```xml
 * <animals>...</animals>
 * ```
 *
 * Basic string array property ({@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md#xmlWrapped `wrapped`} is `false` by default):
 *
 * ```yaml
 * animals:
 *   type: array
 *   items:
 *     type: string
 * ```
 *
 * ```xml
 * <animals>...</animals>
 * <animals>...</animals>
 * <animals>...</animals>
 * ```
 *
 * **XML Name Replacement**
 *
 * ```yaml
 * animals:
 *   type: string
 *   xml:
 *     name: animal
 * ```
 *
 * ```xml
 * <animal>...</animal>
 * ```
 *
 * **XML Attribute, Prefix and Namespace**
 *
 * In this example, a full model definition is shown.
 *
 * ```yaml
 * Person:
 *   type: object
 *   properties:
 *     id:
 *       type: integer
 *       format: int32
 *       xml:
 *         attribute: true
 *     name:
 *       type: string
 *       xml:
 *         namespace: https://example.com/schema/sample
 *         prefix: sample
 * ```
 *
 * ```xml
 * <Person id="123">
 *   <sample:name xmlns:sample="https://example.com/schema/sample">example</sample:name>
 * </Person>
 * ```
 *
 * **XML Arrays**
 *
 * Changing the element names:
 *
 * ```yaml
 * animals:
 *   type: array
 *   items:
 *     type: string
 *     xml:
 *       name: animal
 * ```
 *
 * ```xml
 * <animal>value</animal>
 * <animal>value</animal>
 * ```
 *
 * The external `name` property has no effect on the XML:
 *
 * ```yaml
 * animals:
 *   type: array
 *   items:
 *     type: string
 *     xml:
 *       name: animal
 *   xml:
 *     name: aliens
 * ```
 *
 * ```xml
 * <animal>value</animal>
 * <animal>value</animal>
 * ```
 *
 * Even when the array is wrapped, if a name is not explicitly defined, the same name will be used both internally and externally:
 *
 * ```yaml
 * animals:
 *   type: array
 *   items:
 *     type: string
 *   xml:
 *     wrapped: true
 * ```
 *
 * ```xml
 * <animals>
 *   <animals>value</animals>
 *   <animals>value</animals>
 * </animals>
 * ```
 *
 * To overcome the naming problem in the example above, the following definition can be used:
 *
 * ```yaml
 * animals:
 *   type: array
 *   items:
 *     type: string
 *     xml:
 *       name: animal
 *   xml:
 *     wrapped: true
 * ```
 *
 * ```xml
 * <animals>
 *   <animal>value</animal>
 *   <animal>value</animal>
 * </animals>
 * ```
 *
 * Affecting both internal and external names:
 *
 * ```yaml
 * animals:
 *   type: array
 *   items:
 *     type: string
 *     xml:
 *       name: animal
 *   xml:
 *     name: aliens
 *     wrapped: true
 * ```
 *
 * ```xml
 * <aliens>
 *   <animal>value</animal>
 *   <animal>value</animal>
 * </aliens>
 * ```
 *
 * If we change the external element but not the internal ones:
 *
 * ```yaml
 * animals:
 *   type: array
 *   items:
 *     type: string
 *   xml:
 *     name: aliens
 *     wrapped: true
 * ```
 *
 * ```xml
 * <aliens>
 *   <aliens>value</aliens>
 *   <aliens>value</aliens>
 * </aliens>
 * ```
