# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to Hey API. In order to increase the likelihood of your changes being merged, first open an issue if one does not already exist. Once an issue exists, let us know you'd like to work on it. We will confirm whether we're looking to resolve the issue and provide you with guidance if required. This is to ensure our codebase remains in good state and all features contribute to Hey API's [objectives](/about).

## Prerequisites

You should have a working knowledge of [git](https://git-scm.com), [node](https://nodejs.org/en), and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io).

## Guidelines

Your [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) must:

- address a single issue or add a single item of functionality
- contain a clean history of small, incremental, logically separate commits, with no merge commits
- use clear commit messages
- be possible to merge automatically
