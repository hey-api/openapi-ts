# REST Clients

We all send HTTP requests in a slightly different way. Hey API doesn't force you to use any specific technology. What we do, however, is support your choice with great clients. All seamlessly integrated with our other features.

## Features

- seamless integration with `@hey-api/openapi-ts`
- typesafe response data and errors
- access to the original request and response
- granular request and response customization options
- minimal learning curve thanks to extending the underlying technology
- support bundling inside the generated output

## Available Clients

- [Fetch API](/openapi-ts/clients/fetch)
- [Axios](/openapi-ts/clients/axios)
- [Legacy](/openapi-ts/clients/legacy)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) <span class="soon">Soon</span>

If you'd like a standalone package for your client, let us know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/hey-api/openapi-ts/issues).
