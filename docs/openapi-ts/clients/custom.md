# Custom Client

::: warning
Client API is in development. The interface might change before it becomes stable. We encourage you to leave feedback on [GitHub](https://github.com/hey-api/openapi-ts/issues/1213).
:::

You may need to write your own client if the available clients do not suit your needs or you're working on a proprietary use case. This can be easily achieved using the Client API. But don't take our word for it â€“ all Hey API clients are written this way!

::: warning
Custom clients documentation will be finalized after further testing. Simplified [instructions](https://github.com/hey-api/openapi-ts/issues/1213#issuecomment-2765206344) can be found in the GitHub thread.
