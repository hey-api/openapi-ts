# Web Frameworks

There are two approaches to developing APIs: code-first, where you start with the code, or spec-first, where you begin with the specification. If you use the latter, you can ensure your APIs adhere to the specification with our web framework plugins.

## Options

Hey API natively supports the following frameworks.

- [Fastify](/openapi-ts/plugins/fastify)
- [Adonis](/openapi-ts/plugins/adonis) <span data-soon>Soon</span>
- [Express](/openapi-ts/plugins/express) <span data-soon>Soon</span>
- [Hono](/openapi-ts/plugins/hono) <span data-soon>Soon</span>
- [Koa](/openapi-ts/plugins/koa) <span data-soon>Soon</span>
- [Nest](/openapi-ts/plugins/nest) <span data-soon>Soon</span>
