# Output

Learn about files generated with `@hey-api/openapi-ts`.

::: tip
Your actual output depends on your Hey API configuration. It may contain a different number of files and their contents might differ.
:::

## Overview

If you use the default configuration, your [project](https://stackblitz.com/edit/hey-api-example?file=openapi-ts.config.ts,src%2Fclient%2Fschemas.gen.ts,src%2Fclient%2Fsdk.gen.ts,src%2Fclient%2Ftypes.gen.ts) might look like this.

```md
my-app/
├── node_modules/
├── src/
│ ├── client/
│ │ ├── client.gen.ts
│ │ ├── index.ts
│ │ ├── sdk.gen.ts
│ │ └── types.gen.ts
│ └── index.ts
└── package.json
```

Each file is an artifact generated by a Hey API plugin. This is the default output, we will cover customizing it in this section. These files also form the base for third-party plugins.

Let's go through each file in the `src/client` folder and explain what it looks like, what it does, and how to use it.

## Index

`index.ts` is the only file not generated by a specific plugin. It's meant for convenience and by default, it re-exports every artifact generated by default plugins (TypeScript and SDK).

::: code-group

```ts [index.ts]
export * from './sdk.gen';
export * from './types.gen';
```

:::

We recommend importing artifacts from their files to avoid ambiguity, but we leave this choice up to you.

```ts
import type { Pet } from './client'; // 👎 // [!code --]
import type { Pet } from './client/types.gen'; // 👍 // [!code ++]
```

## Client

`client.gen.ts` is generated by [client plugins](/openapi-ts/clients). If you choose to generate SDKs (enabled by default), you must specify a client which will create this file.

::: code-group

```ts [client.gen.ts]
import { createClient, createConfig } from '@hey-api/client-fetch';

export const client = createClient(createConfig());
```

:::

The contents of this file are consumed by SDKs, but you can also import `client` in your application to perform additional configuration or send manual requests.
