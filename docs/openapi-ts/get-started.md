## Quick Start

The fastest way to use `@hey-api/openapi-ts` is via npx

```sh
npx @hey-api/openapi-ts \
  -i https://get.heyapi.dev/hey-api/backend \
  -o src/client \
  -c @hey-api/client-fetch
```

Congratulations on creating your first client! ðŸŽ‰ You can learn more about the generated files on the [Output](/openapi-ts/output) page.

Before you can make API requests with the client you've just created, you need to install `@hey-api/client-fetch` and configure it. Let's start by declaring your dependencies.

## Installation

::: code-group

```sh [npm]
npm install @hey-api/client-fetch && npm install @hey-api/openapi-ts -D
```

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm add @hey-api/client-fetch && pnpm add @hey-api/openapi-ts -D
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn add @hey-api/client-fetch && yarn add @hey-api/openapi-ts -D
```

```sh [bun]
bun add @hey-api/client-fetch && bun add @hey-api/openapi-ts -D
```

:::

We recommend pinning an exact version so you can safely upgrade when you're ready. This package is in [initial development](https://semver.org/spec/v0.1.0.html#spec-item-5) and its API might change before v1.

### CLI

Most people run `@hey-api/openapi-ts` via CLI. To do that, add a script to your `package.json` file which will make `openapi-ts` executable through script.

```json
"scripts": {
  "openapi-ts": "openapi-ts"
}
```

The above script can be executed by running `npm run openapi-ts` or equivalent command in other package managers. Next, we need to create a [configuration](/openapi-ts/configuration) file and move our options from Quick Start to it.

### Node.js

You can also generate clients programmatically by importing `@hey-api/openapi-ts` in a TypeScript file.

::: code-group

```ts [openapi-ts.ts]
import { createClient } from '@hey-api/openapi-ts';

createClient({
  input: 'https://get.heyapi.dev/hey-api/backend',
  output: 'src/client',
  plugins: ['@hey-api/client-fetch'],
});
```

### Configuration

It is a good practice to extract your configuration into a separate file. Learn how to do that and discover available options on the [Configuration](/openapi-ts/configuration) page.
