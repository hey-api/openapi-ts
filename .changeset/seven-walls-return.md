feat: remove legacy clients and plugins

### Removed legacy clients

This release removes support for legacy clients and plugins. Please migrate to the new clients if you haven't done so yet. If you're unable to do so due to a missing feature, let us know on [GitHub](https://github.com/hey-api/openapi-ts/issues).
